        <h1>Rush (band)</h1>
        <p>
            Rush was a Canadian rock band formed in Toronto in 1968 by Alex Lifeson (guitars, composer), John Rutsey (drums, percussion, lyricist), 
            and Jeff Jones, who was immediately replaced by Geddy Lee (bass, vocals, keyboards, composer). 
            After its formation the band went through several lineup configurations before arriving at its 
            classic power trio lineup with the addition of Neil Peart in July 1974, who replaced 
            Rutsey four months after the release of their self-titled debut album. 
            This lineup remained intact for the remainder of the band's career.

            Rush is known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy and philosophy. 
            The band's style changed over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, 
            later moving into progressive rock, then a period marked by heavy use of synthesizers, 
            before returning to guitar-driven hard rock since the end of the 1980s. 
            The members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, 
            with each winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls.
